I want only modify the GUI because i work on my CNC-chines with a Tablet and the buttons and menus are all to small for my big fingers. I am a absolute beginner in programming and only arange the swingcontrolls on a new place. No modification on the code behinde the GUI.

What is the Goal:

-Dark modern GUI for my Tablet
-all controls little more big
-Fullscreenmode for my tablet (i go over NX (NOMACHINE) in my Raspi and dont need any taskbars or something
-wish me luck, i am a bloody beginner :)
-Codename Grbl remote V1.0
